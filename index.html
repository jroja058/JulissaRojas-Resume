        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanishüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first year Spanish student at UCR. I plan on becoming either a spanish teacher or a translator in the future. Growing up in a Mexican household in the US sometimes makes it harder to communicate with your family. Being the youngest of four, I was highly influenced in speaking English better than my siblings. Because they went to school in Mexico for a few years, they were able to understand the Spanish language better than I ever did. I did grow up speaking Spanish, but it was not formal, it was mostly slang and improper Spanish, like most Mexicans would say, I speak like people from ‚Äúel rancho.‚Äù But instead of being a ‚Äúyo no sabo '' child at such an early age, I began speaking formally with my family and friends at school. Hopefully, this could help me develop my speaking and vocabulary skills. I learned to read in Spanish first so I did not have to start from scratch. My favorite times when reading in Spanish was teaching my cousins from Mexico how to read in Spanish. It was very ironic because I was much younger than them and I lived in the US but yet I taught them how to read in Spanish. 
<br><br>

        I also grew up listening and singing to a lot of Mexican and Spanish music. I have always preferred Spanish music, such as Rock and Alternative, over English music, such as Rap. I felt that Spanish music was more meaningful and powerful to me. This helped me feel as if I was closer to Mexico. Some songs that were deep in meaning had a lot of high vocabulary in Spanish that I did not understand, so I would Google them up and translate them to English. If I liked how the word or phrase sounded, then I would try to incorporate it in my everyday vocabulary. I began using the Spanish keyboard on my phone and Google translate to know the proper uses of words/ phrases and accents in words, such as learning the differences of ‚Äúporque, por qu√©, por que and porqu√©.‚Äù I would always use ‚Äúporque‚Äù thinking there was only one way to spell it, but in fact it could be spelled together, separately, with and without accents. 
<br><br>

        I want to become either a Spanish teacher or translator because I want to help my Latino and Hispnaic community. California is highly influenced by Hispanic culture, but yet there are not a lot of people who speak Spanish greatly. Since at such a young age I would translate important documents to my parents, I knew it was such a struggle for them to understand the English language. There would be times when I would see women struggling to communicate with cashiers at stores, so I would gladly step in and ask them if they needed assistance and I could translate for them. Seeing their smiles on their faces and being very thankful for my generosity, I knew I wanted to help my community feel included and knew there is always a person who knows Spanish.
